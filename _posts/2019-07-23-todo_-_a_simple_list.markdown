#### Get Organized
ToDo is a simple application that allows you to create and keep track of all your tasks. 



As someone who uses a todo list on a daily basis, I wanted to try my hand on creating my own. There were a lot of challenges in this project but it was worth it. I have learnt a lot and the project came out nicely. 

#### Challenges
One of the most challenging part of this lab is to set a session corresponding to the user. To be able to get that working correctly took a bit of time but that is such an integral part of any application so I need to get it right. 

The other challenge on this project is to make sure all the controllers and corresponding views are setup correctly. Making sure the user would land on the right page. 


#### Improvements
It is a very simple todo list, ideally I would have liked to be able to add more style making it more aesthetically pleasing. The other thing is to add a few more functionalities like sharing a task with another user or adding a map function to the task.


Taking it a step further, I would want to be able to integrate with Outlook so that I can use it in a work capacity. Going mobile is also a must have, either through a stand alone app or have it be really mobile friendly through browsers.
