We are currently in the fourth industrial revolution, where technology is already integrated into our everyday lives and it will continue to play a bigger role in our society. 
Artificial Intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology and quantum computing, to name a few. They will no longer be considered emerging technologies. Already, artificial intelligence is all around us from self-driving cars to virtual assistants and software that translates or invest for us.

I want to be a part of this transformation, to work on the next big thing and to be able to contribute to the conversation that might play a role in people's lives. This is why I decided to switch fields and join this program. I hope to build my base knowledge through this boot-camp and start my journey as a developer. This will be my first step.
